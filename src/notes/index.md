::: warning
The purpose of this site and these notes are to provide myself (any anybody who wishes to use them) with a library of various resources and guides. This is primarily for note taking purposes as I personally believe that going through the process of taking notes is the best way to work the knowledge into the mind. By taking notes, and writing down explainations of highly advanced topics, you are able to understand and furthermore **REMEMBER** the material better. This site is completely free, independent, and not for any type of profit whatsoever. Thank you for visiting, feel free to contact me with any questions.
